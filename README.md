# NModule

Library that performs variety of functions, like validation of input.

You may need to import other modules available in other repositories in my account - these imports are in VB.Net (Web Module, General Module, Feedback, Language etc).

Uses:
.NET Framework 4.6

May use:
NewtonSoft.Json 10.0.0

Thanks!
